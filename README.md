This Dashboard is made using Plotly Dash package and is on the topic of OTT platforms.
The app.py file - This code sets up the basic structure for a Dash app and applies the LUX theme from Bootstrap to the app's styling.
The index.py file - This code sets up a multi-page Dash app with a navigation bar at the top of the screen that allows users to navigate between different pages within the app.
